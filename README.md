# LinuxAdminToolGUI
This project develops a GUI tool for managing Linux users, groups, and filesystem permissions. Administrators can easily create, modify, and delete users/groups, assign users to groups, and manage file permissions (read, write, execute). It also includes features for file ownership and access control, all through an intuitive interface.
